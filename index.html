<p> In this first lesson, we will learn about tags. Tags are hidden keywords that tell the browser what a description is about. Tags are pre-defined, so you cannot make your own tags. :( You can think of tags as a human body. The first tag is Doctype. You can think of Doctype as a cap. Since you wear a cap on top of your head, Doctype comes before Head in HTML.</p>
