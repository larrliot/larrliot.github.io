<h1>How can we make a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</h1>
<h2>By E. Huang, C. Taylor, and L. Gorton</h2>
<p>In this example, we are using codepen.</p>
<p>You should make an account first to save your work. It's free!</li>
<p> In this first lesson, we will learn about tags. Tags are hidden keywords that tell the browser what a description is about. Tags are pre-defined, so you cannot make your own tags. :( You can think of tags as a human body. The first tag is Doctype. You can think of Doctype as a cap. Since you wear a cap on top of your head, Doctype comes before Head in HTML.</p>
<p>Hi guys, in our next lesson, we will be learning about the basics of html. In HTML, there are many tags that you can use.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;p&gt;=paragraphs</li>
  <li>&lt;h1 to h6&gt;=header</li>
  <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;=document type</li>
  <li>&lt;title&gt;=title</li>
  <li>&lt;body&gt;=body</li>
  <li>&lt;ol&gt;=ordered list</li>
  <li>&lt;ul&gt;=unordered list</li>
  <li>&lt;li&gt;=list item</li>
  <p></p>
</ul>
